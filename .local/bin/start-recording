Plan to switch between tmux sessions?
  - 1. Leader + CTRL + s to save your sessions
  - 2. tmux kill-server

Going to use a browser?
  - Use one with a cleared history

Various tips:
  - Use CTRL + L instead of running clear to clear your screen as needed
  - Make sure your windows are positioned correctly with Sizer
  - Be mindful of secrets in any .env file!
  - Make sure OBS is actually recording / streaming (if and when applicable)
